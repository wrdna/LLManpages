This uses\\n       the terminfo clear_all_tabs and set_tab capabilities.  If either is ab‐\\n       sent, tabs is unable to clear/set tab-stops.  The  terminal  should  be\\n       configured to use hard tabs, e.g.,\\n\\n           stty tab0\\n\\n       Like  clear(1),  tabs  writes to the standard output.  You can redirect\\n       the standard output to a file (which prevents tabs from actually chang‐\\n       ing the tabstops), and later cat the file to the screen,  setting  tab‐\\n       stops at that point.\\n\\n       These  are  hardware  tabs, which cannot be queried rapidly by applica‐\\n       tions running in the terminal, if at all.  Curses and other full-screen\\n       applications may use hardware tabs in optimizing their  output  to  the\\n       terminal.   If the hardware tabstops differ from the information in the\\n       terminal database, the result is unpredictable.  Before running  curses\\n       programs, you should either reset tab-stops to the standard interval\\n\\n           tabs -8\\n\\n       or  use the reset program, since the normal initialization sequences do\\n       not ensure that tab-stops are reset.\\n<SECTION>OPTIONS</SECTION>\\nGeneral Options\\n       -Tname\\n            Tell tabs which terminal type to  use.   If  this  option  is  not\\n            given,  tabs  will use the $TERM environment variable.  If that is\\n            not set, it will use the ansi+tabs entry.\\n\\n       -d   The debugging option shows a ruler  line,  followed  by  two  data\\n            lines.   The  first  data line shows the expected tab-stops marked\\n            with asterisks.  The second data line shows the actual  tab-stops,\\n            marked with asterisks.\\n\\n       -n   This  option tells tabs to check the options and run any debugging\\n            option, but not to modify the terminal settings.\\n\\n       -V   reports the version of ncurses which was used in this program, and\\n            exits.\\n\\n       The tabs program processes a single list of tab stops.  The last option\\n       to be processed which defines a list is the  one  that  determines  the\\n       list to be processed.\\n\\n   Implicit Lists\\n       Use  a  single number as an option, e.g., “-5” to set tabs at the given\\n       interval (in this case 1, 6, 11, 16, 21, etc.).  Tabs are  repeated  up\\n       to the right margin of the screen.\\n\\n       Use “-0” to clear all tabs.\\n\\n       Use “-8” to set tabs to the standard interval.\\n\\n   Explicit Lists\\n       An  explicit list can be defined after the options (this does not use a\\n       “-”).  The values in the list must be in increasing numeric order,  and\\n       greater than zero.  They are separated by a comma or a blank, for exam‐\\n       ple,\\n\\n           tabs 1,6,11,16,21\\n           tabs 1 6 11 16 21\\n\\n       Use  a  “+”  to treat a number as an increment relative to the previous\\n       value, e.g.,\\n\\n           tabs 1,+5,+5,+5,+5\\n\\n       which is equivalent to the 1,6,11,16,21 example.\\n\\n   Predefined Tab Stops\\n       POSIX defines several predefined lists of tab stops.\\n\\n       -a   Assembler, IBM S/370, first format\\n            1,10,16,36,72\\n\\n       -a2  Assembler, IBM S/370, second format\\n            1,10,16,40,72\\n\\n       -c   COBOL, normal format\\n            1,8,12,16,20,55\\n\\n       -c2  COBOL compact format\\n            1,6,10,14,49\\n\\n       -c3  COBOL compact format extended\\n            1,6,10,14,18,22,26,30,34,38,42,46,50,54,58,62,67\\n\\n       -f   FORTRAN\\n            1,7,11,15,19,23\\n\\n       -p   PL/I\\n            1,5,9,13,17,21,25,29,33,37,41,45,49,53,57,61\\n\\n       -s   SNOBOL\\n            1,10,55\\n\\n       -u   UNIVAC 1100 Assembler\\n            1,12,20,44\\n\\n   Margins\\n       A few terminals expose a means of changing their left  and  right  mar‐\\n       gins.  tabs supports this feature with an option.\\n\\n       +m margin\\n            The effect depends on whether the terminal has the margin capabil‐\\n            ities:\\n\\n            •   If  the  terminal provides the capability for setting the left\\n                margin, tabs uses this, and adjusts  the  available  tab  stop\\n                widths.\\n\\n            •   If the terminal does not provide the margin capabilities, tabs\\n                imitates their effect, putting tab stops at appropriate places\\n                on each line.

Use +m0 to\\n            reset  the  left  margin, that is, to make it the left edge of the\\n            terminal's display.  Before setting a left margin, tabs resets the\\n            margin to reduce problems that might arise from moving the  cursor\\n            to the left of the current left margin.\\n\\n       When  setting  or  resetting  the  left margin, tabs may also reset the\\n       right margin.\\n<SECTION>PORTABILITY</SECTION>\\nIEEE  Std  1003.1/The  Open   Group   Base   Specifications   Issue   7\\n       (POSIX.1-2008) describes a tabs utility.  However,\\n\\n       •   this  standard  describes a +m option to set a terminal's left mar‐\\n           gin.  Very few of the entries in the terminal database provide  the\\n           set_left_margin (smgl) or set_left_margin_parm (smglp) capabilities\\n           needed to support the feature.\\n\\n       •   There  is no counterpart in X/Open Curses Issue 7 for this utility,\\n           unlike tput(1).\\n\\n       The -d (debug) and -n (no-op) options are ncurses extensions  not  pro‐\\n       vided by other implementations.\\n<SECTION>HISTORY</SECTION>\\nA  tabs  utility  appeared  in  PWB/Unix 1.0 (1977).  A reduced version\\n       shipped in Seventh Edition Unix (early 1979) and  in  3BSD  (later  the\\n       same year); it supported a “-n” option to set the first tab stop at the\\n       left margin.  That option is not specified by POSIX.\\n\\n       The  PWB/Unix  tabs  utility  returned  in  System III (1980), and used\\n       built-in tables to support a  half-dozen  hardcopy  terminal  (printer)\\n       types.   It  also had logic to support setting the left margin, as well\\n       as a feature for copying the tab settings from a file.\\n\\n       Versions of the program in later releases of AT&T Unix, such  as  SVr4,\\n       added  support  for  the  terminal database, but retained the tables to\\n       support the printers.  By this time, System V tput had incorporated the\\n       tab stop initialization feature of BSD's tset from 1982,  but  employed\\n       the terminfo database to do so.\\n\\n       The  +m  option was documented in the POSIX Base Specifications Issue 5\\n       (Unix98, 1997), then omitted in Issue 6 (Unix03, 2004) without  express\\n       motivation,  though an introductory comment “and optionally adjusts the\\n       margin” remains, overlooked in the removal.   The  tabs  utility  docu‐\\n       mented in Issues 6 and later has no mechanism for setting margins.  The\\n       +m option in ncurses tabs differs from the SVr4 feature by using termi‐\\n       nal capabilities rather than built-in tables.\\n\\n       POSIX documents no limit on the number of tab stops.  Other implementa‐\\n       tions  impose  one;  the limit is 20 in PWB/Unix's tabs utility.  While\\n       some terminals may not accept an arbitrary number of tab stops, ncurses\\n       tabs attempts to set tab stops up to  the  right  margin  if  the  list\\n       thereof is sufficiently long.\\n\\n       The  “Rationale” section of the Issue 6 tabs reference page details how\\n       the committee considered redesigning the tabs and tput utilities, with‐\\n       out settling on an improved solution.  It claims that\\n\\n           “no known historical version of tabs  supports  the  capability  of\\n           setting arbitrary tab stops.”\\n\\n       The  feature  described in subsection “Explicit Lists” above was imple‐\\n       mented in PWB/Unix, and permitted the setting  of  abitrary  tab  stops\\n       nevertheless.\\n<SECTION>SEE ALSO</SECTION>\\ninfocmp(1M), tset(1), curses(3X), terminfo(5)\\n\\nncurses 6.5                       2024-04-20                           tabs(1)\"}"
